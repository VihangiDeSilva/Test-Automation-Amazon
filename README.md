I've created a automation framework that simplifies the process of adding products to a cart. I've used the webdriverio automation framework along with TypeScript as the programming language to ensure efficient implementation. Additionally, I've integrated cucumber, a testing framework that promotes Behavior-Driven Development principles, to ensure thorough testing and collaboration.
